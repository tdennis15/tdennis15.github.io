## Block Chain & Crypto Currencies (CS 480):

Blockchain is a method to build trust in a network that is inherently trustless. That way actions commited to the blockchain can be certified and any dependencies on that information is stable. There are two main types of blockchains, private and public. Public is the style used by cryptocurrency as everyone can join in, and everyone can have a full copy of the history. The interesting side of private blockchains is that an admin can regulate users and effect control over it.

I developed an application using Hyper Ledger Fabric that was managing the movement of fish in a market setting from a transaction point of view. This was a cradle to grave following of the fish. Covering aspects such as making new IDs with fish being caught, players such as licencing officals, restaurant owners and fishers all having unique IDs. This used a private blockchain setup with an admin able to add and remove users.

Additionally I went through practices of RSA encryption methods and used private and public key encryption to send messages.
