## Operating Systems and Networking (CS 365):

Designed to run through top to bottom the different layers and styles various operating systems use to provide a fluid presentation to its user. This course covered many different structures within operating systems such as modules, monolithic and layered control schemes. A large amount of the studies went to flow control of processes and threads in order to follow from beginning to end the lifecycle of a program.

This project was a java implementation of threads, one of which would produce a unit and another who would consume. They would have random clocks on which one was done with a cycle. Thus there could be times of excess production, or excess starvation. It was to demonstrate how thread waiting could cause problems and potential deadlocks. The majority of the course was also spent covering the various deadlocks and their proposed solutions.

Another part of the course was picking a topic and presenting to the class in a lecture style and answering questions that may arise. I chose the Transfer Communication Protocol to lecture on as it is an important part of networking and something I was curious about.
